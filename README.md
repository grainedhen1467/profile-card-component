## Overview

  The obstacles in this challenge were placing the two bubbles behind the card, also a side challenge that
  would be challenging would be to get the bubbles to remained fixed as you shrink the screen. In the version
  that I created I couldn't achieve this, well not without substantial time loss.

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided
- Get the bubbles behind the image
- Create a white rim around image

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

 What I learned while attempting this challenge started with the background-image position property
 this was the property I used to place the bubbles in the project. It was a bit difficult to understand
 and if you see the code I needed to use relatively hight percentages to move the circles, I wouldn't say
 using the position property is always that intuitive especially outside of push an image to the extreme 
 edges of a containing element. Also, trying to get the bubbles to stay in place once set appeared to be non-trivial. I gave up actually, I'll try something again in the future.

### Continued development

This project taught me the importance to understanding css positioning a lot more. I will continue to work on 
positioning elements.
